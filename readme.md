# Lane Detection For Smart Vehicle Using OpenCV on Raspberry Pi 3b+

### 1. Video Processing: The video footage frames will be sent with the speed of 100 frames per second. This can be reduced if the device being used has lower processing power.

### 2. Applying Canny Edge Detector:


### 3. Lane Area Segmentation:


### 4. Hough transform:


### 5. Visualization and Export:

## To-do:
- [ ] Complete Documentation
- [ ] Include results obtained when a video is input.
- [ ] Add pointers to related Research articles.

## Acknowledgement:
This projects uses OpenCV, Canny Edge Detection Algorithm, Hough Transoformation, and TensorFlow.
